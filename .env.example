# ==== PERFORMANCE NOTES ====
# With these settings, you should experience:
# - 20-100ms transcription latency (down from 4-6 seconds)
# - Nova-3 model for best accuracy
# - Optimized for 16kHz mono audio processing
# - Real-time interim results with final corrections
# - Automatic punctuation and smart formatting

# ==== TROUBLESHOOTING ====
# If you still experience delays:
# 1. Check your internet connection stability
# 2. Verify Deepgram API key is valid and has credits
# 3. Try reducing DEEPGRAM_ENDPOINTING to 50 for even faster detection
# 4. Ensure microphone permissions are granted
# 5. Check Windows audio drivers are up to date
