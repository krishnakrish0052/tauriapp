# 🎤 Transcription System Test Guide

This guide will help you test your enhanced real-time transcription system comprehensively.

## ✅ Quick System Check

Based on your logs, these components are working:
- ✅ **Audio Device Detection**: Found "Stereo Mix" for system audio and "Microphone Array" for mic
- ✅ **Audio Processing**: Converting stereo (960 samples, 2 channels) → mono (480 samples)  
- ✅ **Deepgram Connection**: Successfully connecting with request IDs
- ✅ **Enhanced Features**: Transcription buffer with speaker detection, confidence tracking

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Microphone Transcription
1. **Start the app** with `npm run tauri dev`
2. **Click the microphone button** (should turn blue/active)
3. **Speak clearly**: "Hello, this is a test of the microphone transcription system"
4. **Expected Results**:
   - Console shows: `🚀 Enhanced transcription result: {...}`
   - Frontend displays the transcribed text
   - You should see confidence scores in console
   - Speaker detection should show `👤 Speaker: 0`

### Test 2: System Audio Transcription
1. **Start some audio** (YouTube video, music, etc.)
2. **Click the system audio button**
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Should capture and transcribe the audio playing on your system
   - Same enhanced logging as microphone test

### Test 3: Interim vs Final Results
1. **Start microphone transcription**
2. **Speak a longer sentence slowly**: "This is a test of interim and final transcription results"
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Should see interim results (ending with "...") as you speak
   - Final result appears without "..." when you stop speaking
   - Console shows both `transcription-result` and `enhanced-transcription-result` events

### Test 4: Enhanced Features
1. **Start transcription**
2. **Speak with pauses**: "Hello... (pause 2 seconds) ...how are you today?"
3. **Look for**:
   - **Word count**: `📝 Word count: X`
   - **Final utterances**: `💬 Final utterances: X`  
   - **Duration tracking**: `⏱️ Duration: Xms`
   - **Confidence scores**: Should show percentage in console

### Test 5: Question Detection
1. **Start transcription**
2. **Ask questions**: 
   - "What is your experience with JavaScript?"
   - "How would you handle this situation?"
   - "Can you explain your approach?"
3. **Expected**: Enhanced transcript should detect these as questions

## 🔧 Debugging

### If No Transcription Appears:
```bash
# Check logs for these patterns:
- "Audio processing: X input samples"
- "Deepgram streaming started, request ID: xxx"
- "Transcription result:" or "Enhanced transcription result:"
```

### If Audio Not Captured:
```bash
# Look for these in logs:
- "Using audio device: [device name]"
- "Audio capture started successfully"
- "Using device config: X Hz, Y channels"
```

### If Deepgram Fails:
```bash
# Check for:
- "Failed to create Deepgram client"
- "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY environment variable not set"
```

## 📊 What to Look For

### Console Output (Success):
```
🚀 Enhanced transcription result: {
  transcript: "Hello world",
  is_final: true,
  speaker: 0,
  word_count: 2,
  final_utterance_count: 1,
  total_duration_ms: 1500
}
👤 Speaker: 0
📝 Word count: 2  
💬 Final utterances: 1
⏱️ Duration: 1500ms
Confidence: 95.2%
```

### Frontend Behavior:
- Transcription text appears in the main display area
- Buttons show active state (blue highlight) when recording
- Notifications appear for start/stop events
- Status shows "Live" when ready

### Backend Logs:
```
[INFO] Audio processing: 960 input samples (2 channels) -> 480 output samples
[INFO] Deepgram streaming started, request ID: abc123...
[INFO] Starting real-time transcription with config: AudioConfig { ... }
```

## 🎯 Performance Metrics

Track these metrics during testing:
- **Latency**: Time from speech to transcription appearance (should be <2 seconds)
- **Accuracy**: How well it transcribes your speech
- **Interim Response**: How quickly interim results appear
- **Audio Quality**: No dropouts, consistent processing

## 🚀 Advanced Testing

### Multi-Speaker Testing:
1. Play audio with multiple speakers (interview, conversation)
2. Check if speaker detection works (`👤 Speaker: 0`, `👤 Speaker: 1`, etc.)

### Technical Vocabulary:
1. Say technical terms: "JavaScript", "React", "API", "database", "algorithm"
2. Check if enhanced transcript identifies these as technical terms

### Question Detection:
1. Test various question formats:
   - "What is...?"
   - "How do you...?"
   - "Can you explain...?"
   - "Do you think...?"

## 🔥 Next Steps

After successful testing, you can:
1. **Tune confidence thresholds** in `transcription_buffer.rs`
2. **Add more technical vocabulary** to the dictionary
3. **Enhance speaker diarization** logic
4. **Implement audio preprocessing** (currently disabled)
5. **Add export/save functionality** for transcriptions

## 🆘 Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue**: No audio devices found
**Fix**: Check Windows audio settings, ensure mic/system audio is enabled

**Issue**: Deepgram connection fails  
**Fix**: Verify `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` in your `.env` file

**Issue**: Transcription appears but no enhanced features
**Fix**: Check that frontend is listening to `enhanced-transcription-result` events

**Issue**: Audio processing but no transcription
**Fix**: Check Deepgram API quota and network connectivity
